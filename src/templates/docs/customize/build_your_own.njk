    	<h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Boba was built with modularity in mind. This means that each one of boba's components, be it an element or a utility, can be excluded from the build process without breaking boba as a whole. A master configuration file can be found at <code class="inline">src/scss/all.scss</code>. Use this file to include or exclude various components from the final build.</p>
        
        <h3>Editing SCSS</h3>
        <p>Boba's css is generated from <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> files located in <code class="inline">src/scss</code>. Edit and compile these files to your liking to create a your very own version of boba.</p>

        <h3>Compiling SCSS to CSS</h3>
        <p>Boba uses <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">gulp</a> to compile SCSS into CSS. In order to use gulp, you will need to install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">npm</a>, a package manager used to manage gulp and its dependencies.</p>

        <h5>To build boba:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Clone the official <a href="https://github.com/iFallUpHill/boba" target="_blank">boba repository</a> to your computer.</li>
        	<li>Navigate to the root directory of boba.</li>
        	<li>Run <code class="inline">npm install</code> to install gulp and its dependencies.</li>
        	<li>Once complete, run <code class="inline">gulp clean && gulp build --prod</code> to compile and minify your modified version of boba.</li>
        	<li>Look in the <code class="inline">dist</code> folder for <code class="inline">boba.min.css</code>. This is your customized version of boba!</li>
        </ol>
